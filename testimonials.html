	<p class="color">What a wonderful experience! The two tour leaders who were archaeologists enthralled us with the history of the Islands. The food was bountiful. On the boat the meals were wholesome and delicious. The accommodation on the gulet was more than adequate with rooms being serviced everyday. There was ample deck space to lounge, reading or talking.
	<br>The staff on the Gulet were lovely and attentive. Excellent.</p>
