		<div id="passion">

		<p class="care">Liberty Travel is a leading Australian based travel company with Australia’s largest network of 2,000 independent franchised travel agents. Our widespread and knowledgeable network of travel specialists are passionate about travel and know how to tailor the perfect holiday for each of our clients. We pride ourselves on getting to know all our clients and in learning specifically what you want from your holiday experiences and how we can make that a reality each and every time you travel with us. We are also available to assist you on each step of the holiday journey, from planning to booking to travelling to returning home and to booking again!
		Liberty Travel’s mission is to offer Australian travellers industry-leading service, access to the best value travel deals and unparalleled customer assistance and convenience.
		Because our network of travel agents are passionate and experienced travellers, we understand what goes into making a great holiday experience and we will go the extra mile to make sure each holiday experience we put together is one that our clients will be telling their friends about for years to come – or at least until they come back to plan and book the next life-changing holiday with us!

		<p class="care">Your local Travel Partner is first and foremost a people person. We don’t just book things and send you on your way, we take the time and effort to understand your personality, your situation and your travel requirements. By gaining a real understanding of what you’re looking for, we can then plan your travel to be all you want it to be, making sure everything goes smoothly and without any unexpected pitfalls. Our knowledge means you can relax confident that we have looked after all the little things (many you may not even consider when you are away from home) so you can appreciate the important things. </p>
